            <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">11. Your Data Protection Rights under CalOPPA</h2>
            <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law‚Äôs reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>
            <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
              <li>users can visit our site anonymously;</li>
              <li>our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‚ÄúPrivacy‚Äù, and can easily be found on the home page of our website;</li>
              <li>users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</li>
              <li>users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at <b>contact@fullparty.gg</b>.</li>
